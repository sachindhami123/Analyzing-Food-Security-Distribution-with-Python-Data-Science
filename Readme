🍚📊 Analyzing Food Security Distribution with Python & Data Science 📊⚙️

I recently completed my data science project, in which I analyzing the real-world data from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) dataset, available on NDAP, using Python.

🔍 From data cleaning and transformation to in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation, I uncovered powerful insights into food grain allocation, Aadhaar-linked transactions, and ration card activity across Indian states and years.

Key insights, EDA & visualizations included: 📌 Initial data exploration, missing value checks, and datatype analysis.
📌 Identification of states with the highest food grain allocations.
📌 Aadhaar authentication trends observed over the years.
📌 Correlation between ration card issuance & transaction volumes.
📌 Heatmaps revealing relationships among different features.
📌 Temporal trends analyzed using Year-Month breakdowns for food distribution.

👨‍💻 Tools & Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

💡 Most interesting findings? A consistently high percentage of Aadhaar-authenticated transactions, highlighting the growing digitization and transparency in the public distribution system — a major step forward for efficient governance and food security.

This project help me learn EDA, data wrangling, and visualization skills, it also deepening my overall understanding of how data-driven analysis can support inclusive and sustainable public welfare. 🌱
