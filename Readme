🍚📊 Analyzing Food Security Distribution with  Python & Data Science 📊⚙️

I recently completed a data science project where I analyzed real-world data from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) dataset available on NDAP using Python.

🔍 From data cleaning and transformation to thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation, I uncovered valuable insights into food grain allocation, Aadhaar-linked transactions, and ration card activity across various Indian states and years.

Key Insights, EDA & Visualizations Included:
📌 Initial data exploration, missing value checks, and data type analysis.
📌 Identification of states with the highest food grain allocations.
📌 Trends in Aadhaar authentication observed over recent years.
📌 Correlation analysis between ration card issuance and transaction volumes.
📌 Heatmaps highlighting relationships among different features.
📌 Temporal trends analyzed using Year-Month breakdowns for food distribution.

👨‍💻 Tools & Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.

💡 Most Interesting Findings? A consistently high percentage of Aadhaar-authenticated transactions, indicating the increasing digitization and transparency in the public distribution system — a significant step towards more efficient governance and food security.

This project helped me strengthen my EDA, data wrangling, and visualization skills while deepening my understanding of how data-driven analysis can support inclusive and sustainable public welfare. 🌱
