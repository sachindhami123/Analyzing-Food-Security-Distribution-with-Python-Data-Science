🍚📊 Analyzing Food Security Distribution with Python & Data Science 📊⚙️
I recently complet a data science project analyzing real-world data from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) dataset, available on NDAP, using Python.

🔍 From data cleaning and transformation to in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation, I uncovered powerful insights into food grain allocation, Aadhaar-linked transactions, and ration card activity across Indian states and years.

Key insights, EDA & visualizations included:
📌 Initial data exploration, missing value checks, and datatype analysis. 
📌 States with the highest food grain allocations. 
📌 Aadhaar authentication trends over the years. 
📌 Correlation between ration card issuance and transaction volumes. 
📌 Heatmaps revealing relationships among features. 
📌 Temporal trends using Year-Month analysis for food distribution. 

      
👨‍💻 Tools & Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib,  seaborn, numpy.

💡 One of the most interesting findings? A consistently high percentage of Aadhaar-authenticated transactions, highlighting increasing digitization and transparency in the public distribution system — a major step forward for efficient governance and food security.

This project strengthened my EDA, data wrangling, and visualization skills, while also deepening my understanding of how data-driven analysis can support inclusive and sustainable public welfare 🌱
