🍚📊 Analyzing Food Security Distribution with Python & Data Science 📊⚙️

I recently completed a data science project where I analyzed real-world data from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) dataset, available on NDAP, using Python.

🔍 From data cleaning and transformation to detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and dashboard creation, I uncovered valuable insights into food grain allocation, Aadhaar-linked transactions, and ration card activity across Indian states and years.

Key insights, EDA & visualizations included: 📌 Initial data exploration, missing value treatment, and datatype analysis.
📌 Highlighting states with the highest food grain allocations.
📌 Trends in Aadhaar authentication over the years.
📌 Correlation between ration card issuance and transaction volumes.
📌 Heatmaps showing relationships among key features.
📌 Temporal trends through Year-Month analysis for food distribution.

👨‍💻 Tools & Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

💡 One of the most interesting findings? A consistently high percentage of Aadhaar-authenticated transactions, reflecting the rising digitization and transparency within the public distribution system — a significant step towards efficient governance and food security.

This project helped strengthen my EDA, data wrangling, and visualization skills, while also deepening my understanding of how data-driven insights can support inclusive and sustainable public welfare. 🌱
