🍚📊 Analyzing Food Security Distribution with Python & Data Science 📊⚙️

I recently completed a data science project analyzing real-world data from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) dataset, available on NDAP, using Python.

🔍 From data cleaning to insights:
📌 Initial data exploration, missing value checks, and datatype analysis
📌 States with the highest food grain allocations
📌 Aadhaar authentication trends over the years
📌 Correlation between ration card issuance and transaction volumes
📌 Heatmaps revealing relationships among features
📌 Year-Month analysis of food distribution trends

👨‍💻 Tools Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy

💡 Key Finding: The analysis revealed a consistently high percentage (often exceeding 85%) of Aadhaar-authenticated transactions, demonstrating significant progress in digitizing India's public distribution system — a major step toward transparent and efficient governance in food security.

This project strengthened my EDA, data wrangling, and visualization skills while highlighting how data-driven analysis can support sustainable public welfare programs.
